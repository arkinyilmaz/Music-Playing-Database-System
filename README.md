# Music-Playing-Database-System

  Music playing database system called HeyListen is a web based application, which users can listen and keep track of the songs in more enjoyable and interactive way. This online platform allows users to follow their friends and the singers. Hence there will be followers of the user as well as following ones, which are followed by the user. Users will be informed by the activities of the people they followed. These activities can be as follows:
  - Share song with followers
  - Like/dislike a song, comment, post
  - Follow a playlist, singer or user
  - Buy song or album
  - Followed by someone
  - Join a group
  - Make a playlist

  These activities will have dates with them and will be shown as friendsâ€™ activities on the main page. If a followed singer shares a new song, user will see it on their main page as well. They can comment on these posts and like or dislike it. They can share songs. Furthermore, they can create playlists of their own and sharing this playlist is totally up to user. They can keep it private or public. In order to listen the songs or to add them to their playlists they should first buy the songs. Additionally, users can create a group, hence they will become admin of that group. Admin can invite users to the group and the group can create a playlist together. However, only admin can add these songs to the playlist.

  From the search engine, users can search the songs by their name or they can find singers from there. Differently from users, the singers in the system will have bios, where their information will be shared.
